   *           function also initialises a Git repository in the given
   *           masterlist's parent folder. If the masterlist was not already
   *           up-to-date, it will be re-loaded, but not re-evaluated.
   *
   *           If a Git repository is already present, it will be used to
   *           perform a diff-only update, but if for any reason a
   *           fast-forward merge update is not possible, the existing
   *           repository will be deleted and a new repository cloned from
   *           the given remote.
   *  @param masterlist_path
   *         A string containing the relative or absolute path to the masterlist
   *         file that should be updated. The filename must match the filename
   *         of the masterlist file in the given remote repository, otherwise it
   *         will not be updated correctly. Although LOOT itself expects this
   *         filename to be "masterlist.yaml", the API does not check for any
   *         specific filename.
   *  @param remote_url
   *         The URL of the remote from which to fetch updates. This can also be
   *         a relative or absolute path to a local repository.
   *  @param remote_branch
   *         The branch of the remote from which to apply updates. LOOT's
   *         official masterlists are versioned using separate branches for each
   *         new version of the masterlist syntax, so if you're using them,
   *         check their repositories to see which is the latest release branch.
   *  @returns `true` if the masterlist was updated. `false` if no update was
   *           necessary, ie. it was already up-to-date. If `true`, the
   *           masterlist will have been re-loaded, but will need to be
